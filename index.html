                <h3>Cost of Gambling the Human Factor in Cybersecurity</h3>
                <h4>Cybersecurity, Humans, Technology, MGM breach, Social 
		    Engineering </h4>
                <p>
		   Technology, itself, never makes a mistake. The human programmers
		   that create the technology or instruct the technology what
		   to do are the ones responsible for the errors in technology.
		   Human erors can lead to several different types of cybersecurity 
		   concerns. One of the most recent examples of this can be 
		   seen throught the Las Vegas MGM resorts breach that occurred 
		   in September of 2023. The threat actor was able to breach 
		   their database by simply tricking the helpdesk attendant into 
		   resetting their password. This is known as social engineering, 
		   where attackers manipulate targets into performing certain 
		   actions or revealing specific information. MGM had to shut 
		   down some of its systems to prevent further damage. This 
		   resulted in issues with hotel room digital keys to elevators 
		   to slot machines. MGM was losing about $8.4 million in revnue 
		   alone during the breach. Caesars Entertainment also had to pay 
		   millions of dollars to hackers due to s breach via social 
		   engineering that occured around the same time. Social engineering
		   accounts for 98% of all cyber-attacks due to the human factor.
		   Huamn impact keeps cybersecurity going. Elevating the awareness
		   and understanfing of the human factor and vulnerabilities in 
		   cybersecurity would result in the most effective security 
		   strategy.</p>

                <h3>Women in Cybersecurity</h3>

                <h4>Women, Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p>
                   In 2022, women made up 25% of cybersecurity jobs globally. 
		   Just 1% make up senior leadership positions. Cybersecurity 
		   has an ever-growing variety of threats, thus, diverse
		   perspectives is crucial in this field. American Psychological 
		   Association has proven that men and women have the same innate
	 	   capabilities in math and science. Research shows how women 
		   are equally capable to succeed in the cybersecurity field.
		   The only factor creating this gap between the two genders 
		   are the stereotypes and biases placed by society. In 2020, 
		   cybercrime caused global business a trillion dollar loss. 
		   Thus reversing these sterotypes and biases would greatly 
		   benefit a plethora of companies. A company is as strong 
		   as their line of defense. In cybersecurity, it is crucial 
		   that a company's line of defense is diverse by having a 
		   range of perspectives, experiences, and knowledge contribute.
		   The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency is a great
	     	   example of what women can do in the cybersecurity field. The 
		   agency had a female-leading team that drafted the Blueprint
		   for a SecureCyber Furute, planning and analysis that supports 
		   the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, supporting election security 
		   efforts, developing recommendations for protecting High Value 
		   Asset (HVA) systems across the federal government, and 
		   supporting internal diversity and inclusion programs. 
		   Companies would highly benefit from support women in 
		   pursuing careers in cybersecurity, especially financial
		   benefits.
